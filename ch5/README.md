Chapter 5 has three exercises related to Terraform modules. 

Each of the following folder has an exercise matching the folder name. 

1. root-module-example
2. local-child-module-example
3. remote-child-module-example

Make sure you delete the resources at the end of the exercise as these are real resources getting provisioned in your AWS account and incurs charges. The exercise should not cost more than a dollar if you finish it within 3 to 4 hours. 

Make sure you have cloned the repository. If not, run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hashicorp-Certified-Terraform-Associate-003-Exam-guide-Second-Editon.git

You can navigate to each folder for the exercise depending on your interest. 

cd Hashicorp-Certified-Terraform-Associate-003-Exam-guide-Second-Editon/ch5/root-module-example/

or

cd Hashicorp-Certified-Terraform-Associate-003-Exam-guide-Second-Editon/ch5/local-child-module-example/

or

cd Hashicorp-Certified-Terraform-Associate-003-Exam-guide-Second-Editon/ch5/remote-child-module-example/

You will find the README.md within each folder with instructions to complete the exercise.
